Adding retrievers for custom datasources
========================================

One extension that is likely desired is the addition of more Perceval retrievers. This will allow the PAW to read data from more sources.

Defining the retriever
----------------------
In order to define a retriever, a new instance of `The Perceval Backend Interface <https://github.com/chaoss/grimoirelab-perceval/blob/master/perceval/backend.py>`_ has to be created.

Adding the retriever
--------------------
Now, in order to have your retriever be recognized by Perceval, it needs to be placed at a sub-folder of ``perceval/backends/`` from the perspective of your pyproject.toml, since this is the folder which, upon launch, Perceval will scan for retrievers to use.

For example, see the `Mozilla suite retrievers <https://github.com/chaoss/grimoirelab-perceval-mozilla>`_.


Re-building with the retriever
------------------------------
So you have to re-build the PAW with a customized version of perceval which includes the new backend, // TODO figure out how to build the paw 

Using the retriever
-------------------
Once the PAW has been rebuild with the custom backend, the retriever can be adressed via the mordred config file, and it's datasources annotated like any other backend.
